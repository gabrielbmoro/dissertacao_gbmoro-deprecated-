@article{Li2005,
abstract = {Although intensive work has been done in the area of load balancing, the grid computing environment is different from the traditional parallel systems, which prevents existing load balancing schemes from benefiting large-scale parallel applications. This paper provides a survey of the existing solutions and new efforts in load balancing to address the new challenges in grid computing. We classify the surveyed approaches into three categories: resource-aware repartition, divisible load theory and prediction based schemes.},
